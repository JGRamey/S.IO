# SolomonSophia Project Plan

## Objective
Sophia aims to uncover universal truths by cross-referencing spiritual and religious texts across history, connecting patterns in teachings, tracking changes in translations, doctrines, and interpretations, and identifying logical fallacies and contradictions. The project seeks to highlight shared themes—such as divine good, love, duality, and spiritual gifts—across traditions, from figures like Jesus and King Solomon to modern voices like the Pope, who described religions as "different colors of the ultimate truth."

## Scope
- Analyze primary texts from major and lesser-known spiritual traditions (e.g., Bible, Quran, Upanishads, Gnostic Gospels).
- Track translation histories (e.g., Hebrew to Aramaic to Greek to Latin to English) with linguistic precision.
- Identify and trace specific doctrines and their interpretations within belief systems, noting their evolution.
- Detect logical fallacies, contradictions, and philosophical underpinnings in texts and teachings.
- Contextualize texts within historical eras, societal changes, and philosophical frameworks.
- Provide an accessible, user-friendly platform for exploring these connections with diverse perspectives.

## Dataset Curation
### Sources
- **Primary Texts**: Bible (Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek Septuagint, Latin Vulgate, English NIV/ESV), Quran (Arabic, Persian), Bhagavad Gita (Sanskrit), Torah, Upanishads, Tao Te Ching, Dhammapada, Gnostic Gospels, Zohar, indigenous oral traditions.
- **Reliable Archives**: Project Gutenberg, Sacred-Texts.com, Blue Letter Bible, Perseus Digital Library, JSTOR, Vatican archives, Israel Antiquities Authority (e.g., Dead Sea Scrolls).
- **Historical Context**: Archaeological data, trade route influences, political events (e.g., Council of Nicaea, Athanasius’s Easter letter in 367 CE).
- **Philosophical Works**: Writings of Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and other key philosophers from Perseus Digital Library, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, or academic editions.

### Structure
- **Format**: JSONL with fields for original text, language, translation chain, thematic tags (e.g., love, duality, divine good), doctrine tags (e.g., Trinity, karma), fallacy annotations (e.g., strawman, contradiction), interpretation tags (e.g., Baptist, Sufi), historical context, philosophical alignment, and metadata (e.g., manuscript source, date).
- **Tagging**: Themes like divine revelation; doctrines like atonement; fallacies like ad hominem; interpretations like Calvinist; historical eras like Second Temple Judaism; philosophical concepts like Platonism, aligned across languages using embeddings.
- **Tools**: Hugging Face Datasets library for preprocessing, multilingual support for Hebrew, Arabic, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, etc.

### Translation, Doctrine, Interpretation, and Fallacy Tracking
- Capture texts in their original language, subsequent translations, and modern English versions, with linguistic accuracy ensured by specialized language agents.
- Example: Bible’s path from Hebrew (Old Testament), Aramaic (Daniel), Greek (Septuagint), Latin (Vulgate), to English (NIV/ESV).
- Track doctrinal shifts (e.g., pre-Nicene vs. post-Nicene Christianity), interpretive variations (e.g., Baptist vs. Lutheran), and contradictions (e.g., Genesis 1 vs. 2).
- Identify fallacies (e.g., circular reasoning in apologetics) and philosophical influences (e.g., Platonism in early Christianity).
- Use AI to flag biases (e.g., gendered terms, Athanasius’s apocryphal bans) and contextualize within historical and societal changes.

## AI Agents
Custom AI agents to streamline tasks and enhance accuracy:
1. **Text Sourcing Agent**:
   - Scrapes and verifies texts from trusted digital archives.
   - Flags discrepancies in manuscript editions.
2. **Translation Tracking Agent**:
   - Maps translation lineage (e.g., Codex Sinaiticus to modern translations).
   - Ensures accuracy with metadata cross-referencing.
3. **Perspective Analysis Agent**:
   - Identifies interpretive differences (e.g., Jewish Midrash vs. Christian exegesis).
   - Uses NLP to highlight cultural or doctrinal lenses.
4. **Pattern Recognition Agent**:
   - Tags and connects themes (e.g., “agape” in Christianity, “rahman” in Islam, “metta” in Buddhism).
   - Leverages embeddings for multilingual pattern alignment.
5. **Doctrine Agent**:
   - Identifies specific doctrines (e.g., Trinity, karma, jihad) within texts and belief systems.
   - Tracks doctrinal changes across timelines (e.g., early Vedic vs. later Hindu dharma).
   - Flags when doctrines were introduced, modified, or suppressed (e.g., Athanasius’s 367 CE Easter letter).
   - Cross-references with historical events (e.g., Council of Trent, Islamic schisms).
6. **Fallacy Agents**:
   - **Fallacy Detection Agent**: Identifies logical fallacies (e.g., strawman, slippery slope) in texts or arguments using NLP and logic-based rule sets.
   - **Contradiction Detection Agent**: Flags contradictions within a text (e.g., Gospel resurrection accounts) or across texts (e.g., Quran vs. Bible on Jesus’s crucifixion).
   - **Contextual Fallacy Agent**: Analyzes fallacies in historical context (e.g., ad hominem in early Christian polemics) and links to cultural or political influences.
7. **Language Agents**:
   - **Hebrew Agent**: Specializes in Hebrew language and dialects, ensuring accurate analysis of texts like the Torah or Psalms in their original form.
   - **Aramaic Agent**: Specializes in Aramaic language and dialects, focusing on texts like portions of Daniel or early Christian writings.
   - **Greek Agent**: Specializes in Greek language, analyzing texts like the Septuagint or New Testament in Koine Greek.
   - **Latin Agent**: Specializes in Latin language, focusing on texts like the Vulgate or early Church writings.
8. **Philosophy Agents**:
   - **General Philosophy Agents**: Specialize in areas of philosophical thought (e.g., metaphysics, ethics, epistemology), analyzing arguments, interpretations, and claims in texts for logical coherence and philosophical alignment.
   - **Historical Philosopher Agents**:
     - **Plato Agent**: Specializes in Plato’s teachings, writings (e.g., Republic, Timaeus), and influence on texts like early Christian or Neoplatonic thought.
     - **Aristotle Agent**: Specializes in Aristotle’s works (e.g., Nicomachean Ethics, Metaphysics) and their impact on medieval Christian or Islamic theology.
     - **Descartes Agent**: Specializes in Descartes’s philosophy (e.g., Meditations) and its influence on modern religious thought.
     - Additional agents for other philosophers (e.g., Kant, Aquinas) as needed.
9. **Interpretation Agent**:
   - Analyzes multiple interpretations of texts or belief systems (e.g., Christianity’s Baptist, Pentecostal, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Calvinist denominations).
   - Identifies patterns in interpretive changes, new doctrines, and their societal impacts.
   - Tracks timing of interpretive shifts (e.g., Reformation-era Calvinism) and their implications on doctrines and beliefs.
   - Cross-references with historical and cultural contexts (e.g., Enlightenment influence on liberal theology).
10. **History Agents**:
    - Specialize in specific historical eras, decades, or millennia (e.g., Second Temple Judaism, Medieval Islam, Reformation Europe).
    - Collaborate to provide comprehensive historical context for texts, doctrines, and interpretations.
    - Link societal changes (e.g., Roman Empire’s fall, Enlightenment) to shifts in beliefs or fallacies.
