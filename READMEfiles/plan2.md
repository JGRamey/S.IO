Ignore openai in this plan. We are using huggingface and sentence transformers, and local models and free sources instead. 

Could also use tensorflow if needed and fits overall plan.

# Project Plan for Creating Dataset/Database for Local LLM Training and RAG

**Using Hugging Face, Sentence Transformers, Local Models, and Free Sources**

This plan outlines the steps for creating a comprehensive dataset/database for training and fine-tuning local language models using Hugging Face Transformers, Sentence Transformers, and TensorFlow when needed. The focus is on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Context Windows using completely local and free resources. The backend utilizes PostgreSQL for storage with Python as the primary programming language. Multiple AI agents are developed for content retrieval and analysis, tailored to specific languages and domains.

## Technology Stack (Local & Free)
- **LLM Backend**: Hugging Face Transformers + Ollama
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **Optional**: TensorFlow for advanced models (google/flan-t5-base)
- **Vector DB**: Qdrant (local instance)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector
- **No API Keys Required**: Completely local and free

Step 1: Define Subfields for Each Data Category
Objective: Break down the provided fields into specific subfields to ensure comprehensive coverage and manageable dataset creation.
Tasks:

Identify Subfields: For each of the 39 fields (e.g., Philosophical Books, Quantum Physics, etc.), define specific subcategories to organize content. For example:
Books and Texts on Different Relevant Languages:
Subfields: English Literature, French Literature, German Literature, Spanish Literature, Classical Chinese Texts, Sanskrit Texts, Arabic Texts, etc.


Philosophical Books, Texts, Articles:
Subfields: Ancient Philosophy (Greek, Roman), Medieval Philosophy, Enlightenment Philosophy, Existentialism, Ethics, Metaphysics, Epistemology, etc.


Scientific Books, Texts, Articles:
Subfields: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Earth Sciences, Astronomy, etc.


Religious Books, Texts, Articles:
Subfields: Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Indigenous Spiritual Texts, etc.


Quantum Physics/Mechanics/Computing:
Subfields: Quantum Field Theory, Quantum Entanglement, Quantum Algorithms, Quantum Hardware, etc.


Machine Learning, Data Science, etc.:
Subfields: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Data Visualization, Big Data Processing, etc.


Historical Periods (Ancient, Middle Ages, etc.):
Subfields: Specific eras (e.g., Roman Empire, Byzantine Era), genres (e.g., chronicles, legal texts), or regions (e.g., European, Asian).




Document Subfields: Create a detailed list of subfields in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV) for reference during dataset creation.
Validate Subfields: Cross-reference with dataset.examples folder to ensure alignment with example datasets.

Deliverables:

A JSON/CSV file listing all fields and their respective subfields.
Documentation of subfield rationale (e.g., why specific languages or domains were chosen).

Step 2: Create Database/Dataset for Each Subfield
Objective: Build a PostgreSQL database and populate datasets for each subfield using Mamba for efficient data processing.
Tasks:

Set Up PostgreSQL Database:
Install PostgreSQL and create a database named llm_dataset.
Design schema with tables for:
sources: Stores metadata (title, author, publication year, language, subfield, etc.).
content: Stores raw text or embeddings for RAG (linked to sources via foreign key).
agents: Stores AI agent configurations and metadata.


Example schema:CREATE TABLE sources (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    author VARCHAR(255),
    publication_year INTEGER,
    language VARCHAR(50),
    subfield VARCHAR(100),
    field VARCHAR(100),
    source_type VARCHAR(50) -- e.g., book, article, manuscript
);

CREATE TABLE content (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    source_id INTEGER REFERENCES sources(id),
    raw_text TEXT,
    embedding VECTOR(1536) -- Assuming OpenAI embeddings
);

CREATE TABLE agents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    language VARCHAR(50),
    subfield VARCHAR(100),
    model_name VARCHAR(100),
    status VARCHAR(50) -- e.g., trained, fine-tuned
);




Install Mamba:
Set up Mamba environment: mamba create -n llm_dataset python=3.10.
Install dependencies: mamba install psycopg2 openai pandas numpy sentence-transformers.


Data Collection:
Source data from public domain repositories (e.g., Project Gutenberg, arXiv, sacred-texts.com) or licensed datasets.
Use Python scripts with Mamba to preprocess data:
Clean text (remove formatting, normalize encoding).
Segment texts into chunks suitable for RAG (e.g., 512-token chunks).
Generate embeddings using OpenAI’s API (text-embedding-ada-002) or Sentence Transformers for local processing.


Example Python script for data ingestion:import pandas as pd
import psycopg2
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key")

def process_text(file_path, subfield, language):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        text = f.read()
    # Clean and chunk text
    chunks = [text[i:i+512] for i in range(0, len(text), 512)]
    # Generate embeddings
    embeddings = [client.embeddings.create(input=chunk, model="text-embedding-ada-002").data[0].embedding for chunk in chunks]
    # Store in PostgreSQL
    conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=llm_dataset user=your_user")
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("INSERT INTO sources (title, subfield, language) VALUES (%s, %s, %s) RETURNING id", 
                ("Sample Title", subfield, language))
    source_id = cur.fetchone()[0]
    for chunk, embedding in zip(chunks, embeddings):
        cur.execute("INSERT INTO content (source_id, raw_text, embedding) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)",
                    (source_id, chunk, embedding))
    conn.commit()
    cur.close()
    conn.close()




RAG and Context Windows Setup:
Store embeddings in PostgreSQL using pgvector extension for vector similarity search.
Configure context windows (e.g., 2048 tokens) to include relevant chunks retrieved via cosine similarity.
Example pgvector setup:CREATE EXTENSION vector;
ALTER TABLE content ADD COLUMN embedding VECTOR(1536);
CREATE INDEX ON content USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);





Deliverables:

PostgreSQL database with populated sources and content tables.
Python scripts for data ingestion and embedding generation.
pgvector installed and configured for RAG.

Step 3: Create AI Agents for Each Language
Objective: Develop AI agents tailored to each language used in the subfields for content retrieval and analysis.
Tasks:

Identify Languages: From subfields, list all languages (e.g., English, French, Arabic, Sanskrit, etc.).
Select Models:
English: Use OpenAI’s gpt-4 or text-davinci-003 for robust performance.
Non-English Languages:
Arabic: Use a model fine-tuned on Arabic corpora (e.g., AraBERT or fine-tune gpt-4).
Chinese: Use models like ERNIE or fine-tune gpt-4 on Chinese texts.
Sanskrit: Fine-tune a smaller model like DistilBERT due to limited data availability.
Other languages: Use multilingual models (e.g., mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) or fine-tune OpenAI models.




Agent Architecture:
Each agent retrieves relevant content from PostgreSQL using vector similarity search.
Example agent script:from openai import OpenAI
import psycopg2
import numpy as np

client = OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key")

def retrieve_content(query, language, subfield):
    conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=llm_dataset user=your_user")
    cur = conn.cursor()
    query_embedding = client.embeddings.create(input=query, model="text-embedding-ada-002").data[0].embedding
    cur.execute("""
        SELECT c.raw_text, s.title
        FROM content c
        JOIN sources s ON c.source_id = s.id
        WHERE s.language = %s AND s.subfield = %s
        ORDER BY c.embedding <=> %s LIMIT 5
    """, (language, subfield, query_embedding))
    results = cur.fetchall()
    cur.close()
    conn.close()
    return results




Store Agent Metadata: Record each agent’s language, subfield, and model in the agents table.

Deliverables:

List of languages and assigned models.
Python scripts for AI agent retrieval logic.
Populated agents table in PostgreSQL.

Step 4: Train AI Agents on Datasets
Objective: Train AI agents on the datasets for each subfield to enable accurate retrieval and analysis.
Tasks:

Prepare Training Data:
For each subfield, extract text chunks and metadata from PostgreSQL.
Format data for OpenAI’s API (e.g., JSONL format for fine-tuning).
Example JSONL:{"prompt": "What is quantum entanglement?", "completion": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated..."}




Train Models:
Use OpenAI’s fine-tuning API:from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key")

def train_model(subfield, jsonl_file):
    with open(jsonl_file, 'rb') as f:
        response = client.files.create(file=f, purpose="fine-tune")
    file_id = response.id
    fine_tune = client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(training_file=file_id, model="davinci")
    return fine_tune.id




Monitor Training: Track fine-tuning jobs via OpenAI’s API and log results.

Deliverables:

JSONL files for each subfield.
Fine-tuned model IDs for each agent.
Training logs.

Step 5: Fine-Tune AI Agents
Objective: Fine-tune agents to improve performance for RAG, pattern recognition, claim validation, and rebuttal generation.
Tasks:

Prepare Fine-Tuning Data:
Create datasets with examples of:
Pattern recognition (e.g., identifying themes across texts).
Claim validation/rebuttal (e.g., “X is true because…” or “X is false because…”).
Content generation based on user queries.


Example fine-tuning data:{"prompt": "Validate: 'Quantum computing will replace classical computing.'", "completion": "This claim is partially true. Quantum computing excels in specific tasks..."}




Fine-Tune Models:
Use OpenAI’s API to fine-tune models for each subfield and language.
Focus on tasks: RAG, pattern recognition, claim validation/rebuttal, and content generation.


Test Fine-Tuned Models:
Evaluate agents on sample queries to ensure accurate retrieval and response generation.
Example test:def test_agent(query, language, subfield):
    results = retrieve_content(query, language, subfield)
    response = client.completions.create(
        model="fine-tuned-model-id",
        prompt=f"Query: {query}\nContext: {results}",
        max_tokens=200
    )
    return response.choices[0].text





Deliverables:

Fine-tuned models for each subfield and language.
Test scripts and evaluation results.
Documentation of fine-tuning process and outcomes.

Additional Notes:

Mamba Usage: Mamba ensures efficient dependency management and reproducible environments. Use mamba env export > environment.yml to document the environment.
RAG Implementation: Ensure embeddings are optimized for fast retrieval using pgvector. Adjust chunk sizes and context windows based on model performance.
Context Windows: Set context window sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens) to balance performance and memory usage. Test different sizes during fine-tuning.
Scalability: Use batch processing for large datasets and consider cloud-based PostgreSQL for scalability.
Dataset Examples: Regularly consult the dataset.examples folder to align data formats and quality with provided examples.

Step 1: 1 week (subfield definition).
Step 2: 3 weeks (database setup and data ingestion).
Step 3: 2 weeks (AI agent creation).
Step 4: 3 weeks (initial training).
Step 5: 4 weeks (fine-tuning and testing).

Next Steps:
