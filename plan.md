You are the lead software developer.

Use this file (plan.md) to guide you through the process.

Proceed step by step and use your best judgement to make decisions to make this project successful.

You do not have to follow the outline of this plan. You can modify it as needed. Same goes for the other overview files and project outlines. Your main goal is to make this project successful and the best it can be. If you know something is not needed, delete it and update this file to reflect the changes. If there's a better way to do something, modify it to make it better.

## Completed Tasks 

**Create a .md file to document the files that have been deleted and why they've been deleted. Name the file "delete_files.md".**

**Analyze entire project.**

**Review project.overview.md for a better understanding of the project. It hasn't been updated in a while but it's still a good reference point for the overall aim of the project.**

**Refer to solomon/database/hybrid.md for database setup (ignore the timeline).**

**Refer to solomon/database/postgres.md for PostgreSQL setup.**

**Refer to solomon/database/qdrant.md for Qdrant setup.**

**Reanalyze 1fields.md file and entire subfields.json directory to see if the subfields directory is needed or needs to updated in any capacity considering the hybrid database setup.** 
- Decision: Keep and integrate the subfields.json directory as it provides valuable categorization taxonomy for the hybrid database system.

**Begin setting up the hybrid database.**
- Enhanced database models with hybrid architecture support
- Created Qdrant manager for vector operations
- Updated database connection manager for hybrid system
- Created Alembic migration file for new schema
- Created script to populate categories from subfields.json

**Create blueprint for RAG pipeline and what changes need to be made to the project to support the RAG pipeline. Put it in a new file called "rag_blueprint.md".**

**Update the project.overview.md file to reflect the new hybrid database setup and overall project plan with future AI agents that will be needed to work with the hybrid database and how the scraping system will work.**

## Remaining Tasks 

**Apply the hybrid database migration to create the new tables in PostgreSQL**
- Run: `alembic upgrade head` to apply the migration
- Verify tables are created correctly

**Populate the database with field and subfield categories**
- Run the `solomon/database/populate_categories.py` script
- Verify categories are populated correctly

**Update the data scraping and processing pipeline to populate both databases**
- Modify scraping system to generate embeddings and store in Qdrant
- Update scrapers to use new database schema with field/subfield categorization
- Ensure dual storage (PostgreSQL + Qdrant) for all scraped texts

**Update AI agents to work with the hybrid database**
- Refactor existing agents in `solomon/agents/` to query hybrid database
- Integrate RAG capabilities into agent workflows
- Update agent orchestration for hybrid database operations

**Implement the RAG pipeline components**
- Create RAG manager and supporting classes as outlined in rag_blueprint.md
- Implement query processing and context assembly
- Integrate with local LLM (Ollama/Hugging Face)

**Update entire project with new additions and changes to reflect the overall aim of the project**
- Update CLI commands to work with hybrid database
- Update API endpoints for hybrid database operations
- Ensure all project components are compatible with new architecture

**Testing and validation**
- Test hybrid database operations
- Validate RAG pipeline functionality
- Test AI agent integration
- Performance optimization

## Technology Stack (Confirmed)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector + Qdrant for vector search
- **LLM**: Ollama (Llama 3.2) + Hugging Face Transformers (DialoGPT-large)
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384 dimensions)
- **Optional**: TensorFlow (google/flan-t5-base)
- **Programming**: Python with async/await patterns
- **No API Keys Required**: Completely local and free operation

## Key Architectural Decisions Made
1. **Hybrid Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data + Qdrant for vector search
2. **Field/Subfield Integration**: Incorporated subfields.json taxonomy into database schema
3. **RAG Pipeline**: Comprehensive blueprint created for intelligent text analysis
4. **Local-First**: All models and operations designed to work locally without API dependencies
5. **Agent Enhancement**: Existing AI agents will be upgraded to work with hybrid database

## Next Priority
The immediate next step is to apply the database migration and populate the categories, then proceed with updating the scraping system and AI agents to work with the hybrid architecture.
