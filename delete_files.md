# Deleted Files Documentation

This file tracks all files that have been deleted during the project refactoring and the reasons for their deletion.

## Files Deleted

### Date: 2025-06-22

**Files deleted by user before project analysis:**
- `file:///c:/Users/zochr/Desktop/GitHub/S.IO/subfields.json/fields.md` - Deleted by user, likely replaced with `1fields.md`
- `file:///c:/Users/zochr/Desktop/GitHub/S.IO/hybrid.md` - Moved to `solomon/database/hybrid.md` for better organization
- `file:///c:/Users/zochr/Desktop/GitHub/S.IO/project.overview` - Converted to `project.overview.md` for proper markdown format

**Files deleted during project refactoring:**
- `READMEfiles/plan2.md` - Contents integrated into main `plan.md` file. The plan2.md contained guidance about using local models and free sources, which has been incorporated into the updated project plan and technology stack decisions.

## Pending Analysis

The following files/directories are under review for potential deletion or refactoring:
- `subfields.json/` directory - Evaluating relevance to hybrid database architecture
- Various configuration files that may be redundant

## Deletion Criteria

Files are considered for deletion if they:
1. Are redundant or superseded by newer implementations
2. Don't align with the hybrid database architecture
3. Are outdated or no longer serve the project's goals
4. Create confusion or maintenance overhead

*This file will be updated as the project refactoring progresses.*
