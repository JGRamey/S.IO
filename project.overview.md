# Solomon-Sophia (S.IO) Project Overview

## Objective
Solomon-Sophia aims to uncover universal truths by cross-referencing spiritual and religious texts across history, connecting patterns in teachings, tracking changes in translations, doctrines, and interpretations, and identifying logical fallacies and contradictions. The project seeks to highlight shared themes—such as divine good, love, duality, and spiritual gifts—across traditions, from figures like Jesus and King Solomon to modern voices like the Pope, who described religions as "different colors of the ultimate truth."

## Updated Architecture (2025)

### Hybrid Database System
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for structured data, metadata, relationships, and doctrines
  - Enhanced with pgvector extension for lightweight vector operations
  - Stores text metadata, translation chains, doctrinal references, themes
  - Manages field/subfield categorization system from `subfields.json`
- **Qdrant**: Specialized vector database for high-performance semantic search
  - Stores high-dimensional embeddings (384-dim from sentence-transformers)
  - Optimized for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) search
  - Enables fast similarity search across spiritual texts

### Technology Stack (Local & Free)
- **LLM Backend**: Ollama (Llama 3.2) + Hugging Face Transformers (DialoGPT-large)
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384 dimensions)
- **Optional**: TensorFlow for advanced models (google/flan-t5-base)
- **Vector DB**: Qdrant (local instance, cloud-ready)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **Programming**: Python with async/await patterns
- **No API Keys Required**: Completely local and free operation

### RAG Pipeline Integration
- **Retrieval**: Hybrid search combining Qdrant vector similarity with PostgreSQL metadata filtering
- **Augmentation**: Context assembly with citation tracking and relevance scoring
- **Generation**: Local LLM with specialized prompts for spiritual text analysis
- **Validation**: Response quality checking and bias detection

## Enhanced Scope
- Analyze primary texts from major and lesser-known spiritual traditions (Bible, Quran, Upanishads, Gnostic Gospels, etc.)
- Track translation histories with linguistic precision using enhanced database schema
- Identify and trace specific doctrines and their interpretations within belief systems
- Detect logical fallacies, contradictions, and philosophical underpinnings using AI agents
- Contextualize texts within historical eras and philosophical frameworks
- Provide RAG-powered intelligent querying and cross-tradition analysis
- Support multi-language semantic search and comparative analysis

## Dataset Structure & Categorization

### Enhanced Database Schema
- **Field Categories**: Top-level categorization (Religious Texts, Philosophy, Science, etc.)
- **Subfield Categories**: Detailed subcategorization (Christianity, Buddhism, Ancient Philosophy, etc.)
- **Spiritual Texts**: Core text storage with enhanced metadata and vector integration
- **Translation Tracking**: Complete translation chain management
- **Doctrine & Theme Management**: Structured relationship tracking
- **Analysis Sessions**: RAG query and response logging

### Data Sources Integration
- **Primary Texts**: Multi-language spiritual texts with original language preservation
- **Reliable Archives**: Project Gutenberg, Sacred-Texts.com, Blue Letter Bible, Perseus Digital Library
- **Historical Context**: Archaeological data, manuscript sources, historical events
- **Philosophical Works**: Integration with philosophical texts and frameworks
- **Automated Scraping**: Enhanced scraping system for continuous data collection

## AI Agent Architecture (Updated for Hybrid Database)

   - Provides comparative doctrine analysis across traditions

4. **Theme Recognition Agent**: Powered by vector similarity
   - Uses semantic embeddings to identify universal themes
   - Cross-references themes across different traditions
   - Supports multilingual theme identification

5. **Fallacy Detection Agent**: Integrated with RAG pipeline
   - Identifies logical fallacies using NLP and rule-based systems
   - Provides contextual analysis of argumentative structures
   - Validates reasoning in RAG responses

6. **Contradiction Detection Agent**: Enhanced analytical capabilities
   - Flags contradictions within and across texts
   - Uses vector similarity to find conflicting passages
   - Provides historical context for apparent contradictions

### Specialized Language Agents
- **Hebrew/Aramaic Agent**: Ancient text analysis with historical context
- **Greek/Latin Agent**: Classical text processing with philosophical integration
- **Arabic Agent**: Quranic and Islamic text analysis
- **Sanskrit Agent**: Hindu and Buddhist text processing
- **Multi-language Coordination**: Cross-language semantic analysis

## RAG-Powered Features

### Intelligent Querying
- **Semantic Search**: "What do different traditions say about divine love?"
- **Comparative Analysis**: "Compare Christian and Islamic views on prayer"
- **Historical Tracking**: "How has the Trinity doctrine evolved?"
- **Cross-Reference**: "Find similar themes in Hindu and Christian texts"

### Advanced Analytics
- **Pattern Recognition**: Universal themes across traditions
- **Evolution Tracking**: Doctrinal and interpretive changes over time
- **Contradiction Analysis**: Systematic identification of conflicting teachings
- **Bias Detection**: Cultural and historical bias identification

### Multi-Modal Integration
- **Text Analysis**: Primary focus on written spiritual texts
