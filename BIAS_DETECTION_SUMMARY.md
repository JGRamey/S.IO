## 💻 **Usage Examples**

### **Through MCP Client**
```python
from yggdrasil_mcp_client import YggdrasilMCPClient

client = YggdrasilMCPClient()
await client.connect()

# Analyze text for bias
result = await client.ai_content_analysis(
    text="Obviously, Western philosophy is superior to Eastern thinking...",
    analysis_type="bias_detection",
    domain="philosophy",
    metadata={"sensitivity": "high"}
)

# Print detailed results
client.print_analysis_summary(result)
await client.disconnect()
```

### **Command Line Interface**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run bias detection analysis
python3 yggdrasil_mcp_client.py ai_analyze \
    --text "Women are naturally more emotional than men" \
    --analysis-type bias_detection \
    --domain philosophy
```

### **Standalone Testing**
```bash
# Test core functionality
python3 bias_test_standalone.py

# Output:
# ✅ All tests PASSED!
# 🎉 Bias detection is working correctly!
# 🚀 Ready for MCP integration!
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Algorithm**
1. **Pattern Matching**: Regex-based detection of bias keywords and phrases
2. **Linguistic Analysis**: Absolute language and problematic constructions
3. **Context Analysis**: Surrounding text affects confidence scoring
4. **AI Enhancement**: Optional LLM-based subtle bias detection
5. **Deduplication**: Remove overlapping detections
6. **Ranking**: Sort by confidence and severity

### **Data Structures**
```python
@dataclass
class BiasDetection:
    bias_type: str          # Type of bias detected
    confidence: float       # 0.0-1.0 confidence score
    text_snippet: str       # Actual biased text
    explanation: str        # Why this is considered bias
    severity: str          # low, medium, high, critical
    start_position: int    # Position in original text
    end_position: int      # End position in original text
    suggestions: List[str] # Recommendations for improvement
    category: str          # cognitive, cultural, social, etc.
```

### **Integration Points**
- **MCP Agent Manager**: Added to agent initialization and routing
- **MCP Server**: New `bias_detection` analysis type available
